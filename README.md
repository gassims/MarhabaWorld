# Programming languages are fun in different ways. For example, I think C# is more fun than all other languages because of the visual programming it provides without decreasing the power of the code; on the other hand, although Python is not so good for visual programming it has interesting modules and can be used for machine learning. HTML, CSS, PHP are great for developing websites, and Javascript helps one code "smarter" and adds more power to the code. Having fun with these languages and exploring different uses makes programming easier and more intelligent. :D
